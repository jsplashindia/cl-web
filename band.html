A doctor by profession, he is currently working and residing in Mangalore. The enigma of music captured him at a young age of 10 when he started playing the violin and keyboard. He developed his singing skills by being part of the church choir. His parents and sister were a constant support and his passion was thus moulded well. This wonderful journey has opened a new chapter in his life as he continues to pursue his passion. His favourite artists and bands are Paul Baloche, Tobymac, Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, Petra and many more.  He hopes to inspire and spread the melody to his audience through innovative arrangements that blends strings with Christian and pop rock.  The vision is to share His love through the channel of music.<br><br><strong>Bijoy Thangaraj</strong><br><em>Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitars</em></p><p>Bijoy Thangaraj was born in Tamil Nadu, brought up in Trivandrum, Kerala and is currently working at Bangalore. Bijoy was inclined to music right from his childhood. Bijoy started playing and composing music at the age of 10. He plays Guitar, Keys, Harmonica, Drums and has done grades in Solo Piano from Trinity College, London.

Right from his childhood, he had a keen interest towards music. At an early age of 11, he started playing the keyboard in a Church. His passion for music made him explore various musical instruments. At this juncture he strongly felt that his hands were tuned to play the Lead Guitar; there was no turning back ever since. It was a journey of vigorous practice, sleepless nights (would rather rephrase it as musical nights)! He has a wide range of musical influence from Blues to Metal, not limiting himself to any specific genre. Besides playing the guitar and keyboard, he also plays drums and bass guitar. He has performed in various concerts and has also played in studio recording as a session guitarist. Besides music, he also preaches and teaches the Word of God at Churches and at youth meetings and encourages people to have a closer walk with God.<br><br><strong>Isaac Theogaraj<br></strong><em>Bass</em></p><p>Isaac is from south India.
